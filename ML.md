Machine learning algorithms learn from data to solve problems that are too complex to solve with conventional programming.

# Definition :

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that includes methods, or algorithms, for automatically creating models from data.

A machine learning system learns from experience.

The performance of a machine learning system can be improved through training, by exposing the algorithm to more data.

Machine learning algorithms are often divided into **supervised** (the training data are tagged with the answers) and **unsupervised** (any labels that may exist are not shown to the training algorithm). 

_Supervised_ machine learning problems are further divided into **classification** (predicting non-numeric answers, such as the probability of a missed mortgage payment) and **regression** (predicting numeric answers, such as the number of widgets that will sell next month in your store).

_Unsupervised_ learning is further divided into **clustering** (finding groups of similar objects, such as running shoes, walking shoes, and dress shoes), **association** (finding common sequences of objects, such as coffee and cream), and dimensionality reduction (projection, feature selection, and feature extraction).
