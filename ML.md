Machine learning algorithms learn from data to solve problems that are too complex to solve with conventional programming.

# Definition :

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that includes methods, or algorithms, for automatically creating models from data.

A machine learning system learns from experience.

The performance of a machine learning system can be improved through training, by exposing the algorithm to more data.

Machine learning algorithms are often divided into **supervised** (the training data are tagged with the answers) and **unsupervised** (any labels that may exist are not shown to the training algorithm). 

_Supervised_ machine learning problems are further divided into **classification** (predicting non-numeric answers, such as the probability of a missed mortgage payment) and **regression** (predicting numeric answers, such as the number of widgets that will sell next month in your store).

_Unsupervised_ learning is further divided into **clustering** (finding groups of similar objects, such as running shoes, walking shoes, and dress shoes), **association** (finding common sequences of objects, such as coffee and cream), and dimensionality reduction (projection, feature selection, and feature extraction).

_Reinforcement learning_ (RL) is a machine learning technique where an autonomous "agent" learns to make optimal, sequential decisions by interacting with an environment, using a trial-and-error approach. Instead of relying on labeled data, the agent receives feedback through rewards or penalties, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

**Classification algorithms**

A classification problem is a _supervised learning problem_ that asks for a choice between two or more classes, usually providing probabilities for each class. Leaving out neural networks and deep learning, which require a much higher level of computing resources, the most common algorithms are Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). You can also use ensemble methods (combinations of models), such as Random Forest, other Bagging methods, and boosting methods such as AdaBoost and XGBoost.

**Regression algorithms**

A regression problem is a _supervised learning problem_ that asks the model to predict a number. The simplest and fastest algorithm is linear (least squares) regression, but you shouldn’t stop there, because it often gives you a mediocre result. Other common machine learning regression algorithms (short of neural networks) include Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization), LARS Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. You’ll notice that there is some overlap between machine learning algorithms for regression and classification.

**Clustering algorithms**

A clustering problem is an _unsupervised learning problem_ that asks the model to find groups of similar data points. The most popular algorithm is K-Means Clustering; others include Mean-Shift Clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models), and HAC (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering).

**Dimensionality reduction algorithms**

Dimensionality reduction is an _unsupervised learning problem_ that asks the model to drop or combine variables that have little or no effect on the result. This is often used in combination with classification or regression. Dimensionality reduction algorithms include removing variables with many missing values, removing variables with low variance, Decision Tree, Random Forest, removing or combining variables with high correlation, Backward Feature Elimination, Forward Feature Selection, Factor Analysis, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

**Optimization methods**

Training and evaluation turn supervised learning algorithms into models by optimizing their parameter weights to find the set of values that best matches the ground truth of your data.
